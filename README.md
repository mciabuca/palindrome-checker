# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web application that checks if a given text is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for checking if the input text is a palindrome.
- `style.css`: This CSS file contains the styles for the web page.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter the text you want to check in the input field.
3. Click the "Check Palindrome" button.
4. The result will be displayed below the button.

## Features

- Responsive design: The layout adjusts to screen size, making it compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
- User-friendly: Provides alerts when the input field is empty.

## Future Improvements

- Add more complex palindrome checking, such as ignoring diacritical marks in languages other than English.
- Improve the UI/UX design for a better user experience.
